This repository combines several projects focused on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks related to chemistry. Here, you'll find resources for:

*1. ChatGPT Systems with the ChatGPT API*

This project focuses on creating systems utilizing the ChatGPT API. It explores different ways to integrate ChatGPT into existing systems, such as chatbots, customer support systems, and more. By leveraging the ChatGPT API, developers can easily incorporate conversational AI capabilities into their applications.

*2. ChatGPT Prompt Engineering*

The ChatGPT Prompt Engineering project delves into the art and science of crafting effective prompts for ChatGPT. Prompts play a crucial role in guiding the model's responses and steering the conversation in desired directions. This project explores various techniques and strategies for designing prompts that yield coherent and contextually relevant responses from ChatGPT.

*3. Chatbot for Chemistry*
In the Chatbot for Chemistry project, we explore the application of ChatGPT in the domain of chemistry. By fine-tuning the model on chemistry-related data and prompts, we aim to develop a chatbot capable of assisting with various chemistry-related inquiries. Whether you're a student seeking help with homework or a researcher looking for quick references, this chatbot endeavors to provide useful and accurate information in the field of chemistry.

*4. Fine-Tuning GPT for Chemistry*
This project focuses specifically on fine-tuning the GPT model for tasks related to chemistry. Fine-tuning involves training the model on domain-specific data to improve its performance on specialized tasks. By fine-tuning GPT for chemistry, we aim to enhance the model's understanding and generation of chemistry-related content, enabling it to provide more accurate and insightful responses in chemistry-related applications.
